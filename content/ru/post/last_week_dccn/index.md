# About DCCN

(DCCN)[https://dccn.ru/] is Distributed Computer and Communication Networks: Control, Computation, Communications.

The main idea of the conference is to provide a platform and forum for researchers and developers from academia and industry from various countries working in the area of theory and applications of distributed computer and communication networks, mathematical modeling, methods of control and optimization of distributed systems, by offering them a unique opportunity to share their views as well as discuss the prospective developments and pursue collaboration in this area. This conference is held both by the Institute of Control Science Russian Academy of Science ((ICS RAS)[https://www.ipu.ru/en]) and Peoples' Friendship University of Russia ((RUDN)[https://www.rudn.ru/]). In this year the main organazer was the RUDN.  

# Schedule

## First day

At the first day the plenary talks were made. Professor from India (Neeraj Kumar)[https://dccn.ru/keynotes/kumar] talked about Quantum Blockchain for Next Generation Networks Scenarios: Use Cases, Challenges and Future Directions. Professor (Abdelkader Laouid)[https://dccn.ru/keynotes/laouid] from Algirea talked abot The Escalating Cybersecurity Threats in the Era of Quantum Computers: Challenges and Solutions. Doctor (Sachin Sharma)[https://dccn.ru/keynotes/sharma] from India named his talk Repeated Line Tracking and Multiline Neighbouring Relation (RLMN) framework for finger vein template security. Finally we were listening presentation of Holographic City - CitiVerse from our own dear doctor (Ammar Muthanna)[https://dccn.ru/keynotes/muthanna]. Head of our department Professor Konstantin Samouilov was realy exited our guests and invite them in the common project. 

## Second and third day

In the second and third days, the conference worked in three parallel tracks, each consisting of three sections. I was on track A, called Computer and Communication Networks: Architecture, Protocols, and Technologies. With the main theme related in the name of track the other important common theme became an artificial intellegent. Unfortunately, it was the least-visited track, so I heard few talks, but it was enjoyable from the point of view of organizing this track.

## No oficial part

Our guests were invited to a guided tour and the theatre. As an unofficial part, we also hosted two luxury gala dinners with delicious food.

# My role

## My talk

Traditionally, I have talked about wireless multi-hop half-duplex networks. I prepared a short talk where we only checked end-to-end delays and the variation in channel capacity. Surprisingly, this variation had almost no influence on the average delay and the 99th percentile of delays. The only thing that we noted was that in a highly loaded system, under a link scheduling policy based on queue lengths, the end-to-delay slightly increased with the variation in the channel throughput, but no dependence occurred in other conditions.

## Organization 

There was a large group of volunteers who worked to make the event comfortable and smooth. With about 10 volunteers, we had no chance of failure due to reservations. Personally, I met the guests in the hall, guided them to lunch, prepared a room, and provided online translation services. It was easy, but it took all my times. So it was a very interesting feeling to actively work, but never get tired.
