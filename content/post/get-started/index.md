# Combining science, study, travel and party

At the last week I was hapier to be part of the XV International Conference Computer-Aided Technologies in Applied Mathematics (ICAM 2024). Now a make some resume of this expirients. 

## My talk

I making a talk about appliing reinforcement learning to the Integrated Access and Backhaul 5G/6G system. This work were on of the extensions of my graduation project. Here we try to find the most effective link scheduling policy, but conclude, that the reinforcement learning approach is not the best not only in terms of computational complexity (which is obvious), but also in terms of average packet end-to-end delay. 

## Beauteaful Altay

We have visit five excursion, where we see a lot of beautifuls a natural landmark as a river, cave, mountain, forest. Also we visit a Gorno-Altaysk city. 

## Community

We have met a researchers from Chelyabinsk South Ural Institute, Tomsk State University, Institute of System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Kazan State University, Yekaterinburg University of Architecture, Novosibirsk State University. 

## Science 

The themes of a conference include neural networks, queueing systems, simulation, archtecture, logical synthesis of hardware circuits, engineering, weather forecasting and others.

## Rest with friends

Every evening I spend with my friends talking, playing and cooking. 

## Studiing at night

During a conference I have to do my homework. In spite of my prepearing before trave, I do my hovework every night for a two hours.
