# Combining science, study, travel and party

During the last week, I was happy to be part of the 15th International Conference on Computer-Aided Technologies in Applied Mathematics (ICAM 2024). I would like to summarize my experience.

## My talk

I was talking about applying reinforcement learning to the integrated access and backhaul 5G/6G systems. This work is one of the extensions to my graduation project. We are trying to find the most effective link scheduling policy here, but we conclude that the reinforcement learning approach is not the best, not only in terms of computational complexity, which is obvious, but also in terms of average packet end-to-end delay.

## Beauteaful Altay

We visited five excursions where we saw a lot of beautiful natural landmarks such as rivers, caves, mountains, forests. Also, we visited the city of Gorno-Altaisk.

## Community

We have met researchers from Chelyabinsk South Ural Institute, Tomsk State University, the Institute of System Programming at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Kazan State University and Yekaterinburg University of Architecture.

## Science 

The themes of the conference include neural networks, queueing systems, simulation, architecture, logical synthesis of hardware circuits, engineering, weather forecasting, and others.

## Rest with friends

Every evening I spend time with my friends talking, playing and cooking. 

## Studiing at night

During a conference, I have to do my homework. Despite my preparation before travelling, I do my homework every night for two hours.
