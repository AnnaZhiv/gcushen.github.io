# Belarus

During the last week, I was travel to the Belarus with group of pupils from my school. Three days in a other county were very saturated and bright. 

## Format 

I traveled in a group of 40 participants, most of whom were pupils. We were all together and followed a predetermined program. It was more like a holiday than a trip, where I was responsible for organizing everything as usual. It felt like an extended weekend for me, as it was between two work weeks. One advantage of this format was that we had a comfortable bus that stopped whenever we wanted, and a guide who told interesting stories. However, a disadvantage was that our speed was slow. At every stop, we had to wait for everyone to use the toilet or finish checking out an exhibition. Nevertheless, I understand that this was a necessary part of the experience, and that I should have relaxed and enjoyed it, rather than staying in intensive work mode for a month in a row.   

## Similiarity to Russia

- Language. Sometimes the inscriptions are duplicated in Belarusian, but duplication in the local language is used in every republic in Russia.      


## Differences to Russia

- Money. 1 Belarusian rubel is equal to 31 Russian rubel.      
- Religion. There are a lot of Catholic Churches.     

## Visited attractions

- Minsk is the capital of Belarus. The city seems new and accurare, because it was complitely rebuilt after the Second World War.     
- Khatyn. Memorial in honor of the killed civilians. During the Second World War evety third Belarusian was killed.     
- Two castles. In the town of Mir and Nesvizh.     
- Belovezhskaya Pushcha Nature Reserve. Semms like an ordinal forest, but contain a bisons.     
- Brest fortress. The fortress, which was the first to be attacked during the Great Patriotic War.     
- Brest. City that is 1000 years old. City that was part of two different countries and cultures.
