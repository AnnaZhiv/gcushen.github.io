# Pesentation

It is important to share the results of your research with others. 
Scientific presentations are an essential tool for researchers. 
Now I introduce some ideas about prepearing presentations.

## Parts of presentation 

In the presentation you shoul   
- Introduce yourselt    
- Give a motivation for the talk    
- Explain an object, subject, aim, tasks and methods       
- Present a results     
- Make a conclusion     

You also can add    
- Outline of the presentation     
- Bibliography     

## Mistakes in the presentations 

- Too much text in the slide     
- Different fonts and cegles. Bright colors    
- Too much details    
- Too quik slide show     
- Reading the slides    

## Recomendation

- One slide should be in focus no less than 1 minute     
- One slide should contain one main  idea     
- One slide should contain no more than 7 entities      
- Use graphical items (pictures, schems, diagrams, graphs)     
- Minimize text on the slide      
- Prepear you talk, but not memorize text
