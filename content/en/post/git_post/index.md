# Github

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

Github --  is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available. In addition, the site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called Gollum), and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions ("forks") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others repositories, and review changes to code. GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free. On April 14, 2020, GitHub made "all of the core GitHub features" free for everyone, including "private repositories with unlimited collaborators."

The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself, written by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath, Hyett, and Preston-Werner.

In addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:    
- Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats     
- GitHub Actions, which allows building continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms    
- GitHub Codespaces, an online IDE providing users with a virtual machine intended to be a work environment to build and test code    
- Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members    
- Integrations Directory    
- Email notifications     
- Emojis    
- Visualization of geospatial data    
- 3D render files can be previewed using an integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas." The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three.js.    
- Support for previewing many common image formats, including Photoshop's PSD files    
- PDF document viewer    
- Security Alerts of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in different packages    

# What I use  
 
From all this divercity I only use three comands

``` 
git add . 
git commit -am ''
git push --force
``` 

And I do so only for my homework, not with personal aims. But who knows maybe in one day I will really need for version control....     
In my current life I use version control only in overleaf and I enjoy it! It make opportunity GitHub once will be helpful for me.


Worth noting that in the past month, I have learned new things about GitHub. 
For example, GitHub pages, which are used in this project, seem to be useful. 
Thanks to Professor Dmitri Kulyabov, I am now familiar with the GitHub tool, which is obviously a great tool for developers. 
However, I am not yet ready to dive deep into this system. If I need it again, though, I won't be so confused by it.
