## LaTex is markup language

A markup language is a type of computer language that uses special characters or sequences of characters to add information about the structure and presentation of text. It belongs to the category of computer languages and is used to create documents that contain not only the actual text, but also additional information such as headings, lists, and other formatting elements.

The only idea of markup language was appear at 1967. And in 1980s Donald Knut creates Tex markup language, which appears to be so powerful and useful tool that it is widely used until today. LaTex is a mackropaket of TeX. 

## LaTex functions

LaTex alows authors to only wrote a content and LaTex himself carry about
- The numbering of sections and formulas     
- Accommodation links     
- Placement of illustrations and tables     
- Design of mathematical formulas     
- Hyphenation    
- Definition mezhduslovnyh gaps     
- Balancing of text in a paragraph     
- Generation of content table, list of illustrations and list of tables     
- Design of the algorithms, source code with syntax highlighting    
- Maintain the bibliography     

## Technical issues

As usual, to use wonderful featured tool you must pass through instalation process, which is often is not very simple. But it is not about LaTex.

### Distributives

LaTeX is free software, and anyone is free to share it in any way they choose. At the moment, there are two main distributives:

1. TeXLive -- the main version, available for Win/Mac/Linux, preinstalled (about 3-4 GB)   
2. MiKTeX - available only for Windows, offers dynamic package loading during installation. It has a low installation size, but requires the internet to download packages. Users have complained about slow downloads (typical installation is 500-800 MB).

MacTeX and ProTeXt are also available as extensions of TeXLive and MiKTeX, respectively.

### Compilers 

there are four main Latex compilers:

- LaTeX. It only supports the image file formats .eps and .ps. If all images in your project are in the .eps format, it is recommended to use the This compiler.    
- PDFLaTeX. It supports image formats such as .png, .jpg, and .pdf, and converts .eps images to .pdf during the compilation process, which may increase the required time for compilation.    
- XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, "out of the box", reliably support UTF-8 as well as TrueType and OpenType fonts. Therefore, they are recommended if you need to use non-Latin characters. They also support image formats such as .png, .jpg, .pdf, and .eps.    
XeLaTeX supports PStricks, while LuaLaTeX does not.     

## Usage

Personally, I use LaTeX almost every day. I write my homework, my work, and my notes using LaTeX. I also write presentations using LaTeX. For me, it is convenient and fast, and I enjoy the beautiful results. Mostly, I use the Overleaf online editor for LaTeX, but I also have a lot of LaTeX notes inside my Jupyter notebooks. I use Microsoft PowerPoint, where I can draw my figures, to create presentations with LaTeX formulas. I only used a local LaTeX repository once, when preparing my graduation work. I recommend LaTeX to everyone. Give it a try and you will love it for all time!
