# How does it was? 

## Work

I was a intense week! We have 
- Only two plenary talks     
- Three days of working sections by 8 hours     

Also we had a gala dinner, where we establish long term scientific relations. 

## Traveling 

Uzbekistan is not a Russia, so we were completely abroad and have some unique experience.    
- Our simCards does not working    
- Our money have no value     
- Our language was partially inunderstandable    

So, we were interested in exploiring a local culture and do some things    
- We walk around the Karshi city by fith hours     
- We have viseted Shakhrizabs culture complex    
- We have viseted Bukhara culture complex, but unfortunately only for thre hours    
- We have guided walk in the Samarkand city for whole day       
- We tested a lot of local dishes such as pilaf, lamb kebab, lagman, samsa     

## Live

Huge lack of sleep! We flight at night, so there was no sleep. Also I have to do my homework everyday by two hours, so I sacrifice sleep.
